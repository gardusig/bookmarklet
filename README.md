# Bookmarklet Repository
This repository contains JavaScript files that can be converted into bookmarklets for easy execution in web browsers.

## Getting Started
To convert a TypeScript file (example.ts) into a bookmarklet, follow these steps:

Ensure your TypeScript file (example.ts) contains the code you want to convert into a bookmarklet. This could include functionality for enhancing web pages, automating tasks, or interacting with specific websites.

```
npx tsc example.ts --outDir ./dist
```
