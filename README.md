# Bookmarklet Collection

This repository contains a collection of useful bookmarklets designed to automate tasks on various web pages.

## Getting Started
To convert a TypeScript file (example.ts) into a bookmarklet, follow these steps:

Ensure your TypeScript file (example.ts) contains the code you want to convert into a bookmarklet. This could include functionality for enhancing web pages, automating tasks, or interacting with specific websites.

```
npx tsc example.ts --outDir ./dist
```

Then use this website: https://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter/

## Available Bookmarklets

   - Automates the process of playing audio on Google Translate, monitoring the player's status, and navigating to the next page when necessary.

More bookmarklets will be added as they are developed!
