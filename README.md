# Bookmarklet

Collection of useful bookmarklets designed to automate tasks on various web pages.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Prepare Your TypeScript File
Ensure your TypeScript file (`example.ts`) contains the code you want to convert into a bookmarklet.

### Step 2: Build the Bookmarklet
Use the `build.js` script to compile and format your TypeScript file into a bookmarklet.

```
node build.js <path-to-typescript-file> <output-name>
```

Output will be located in `dist/<output-name>.bundle.js`.
